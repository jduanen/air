Air quality monitoring sensors

## airair!

BTLE-based air quality measurement based on Sharp optical sensor.

Kickstarter premium from several years ago.  No longer supported.

See docs/ for all the information I've been able to gather on it.

Sensor output has a significant no-dust noise level.
The noise follows a fairly consistent distribution, with a variance that is fairly constant,
and a mean is positively correlated with temperature.

## Grove Laser PM2.5 Sensor (HM3301)
